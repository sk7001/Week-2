## Overview
This week was dedicated to mastering the core principles of object-oriented programming in Java. We explored how to design and implement classes and objects, use constructors and access modifiers, understand static and instance variables, leverage inheritance and polymorphism, and apply abstraction and encapsulation. These concepts are fundamental for building robust, maintainable, and reusable Java applications.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: OOP Concepts and Classes
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Benefits of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Understanding objects and classes
- Defining classes and creating objects in Java

### Day 2: Constructors, Variables, and Access Modifiers
- Constructors and their types
- Instance vs. class (static) variables
- Access modifiers: public, private, protected, default
- Best practices for variable scope and encapsulation

### Day 3: this, static, final, and instanceof
- The 	his keyword and its uses
- The static keyword for class-level data and methods
- The inal keyword for constants and immutability
- Using instanceof for type checking

### Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagrams
- Principles of object modeling
- Drawing and interpreting class diagrams (UML)
- Modeling relationships: association, aggregation, composition

### Day 5: Inheritance
- The concept and benefits of inheritance
- The extends keyword and superclass/subclass relationships
- Method overriding vs. overloading
- The super keyword

### Day 6: Encapsulation, Interface, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Defining and using interfaces
- Abstract classes and methods
- Polymorphism: compile-time and runtime
- Implementing and using polymorphic code

## How to Use This Repository
Each topic and concept is organized in its own folder or file. Review the code samples, complete the assignments, and practice applying OOP concepts to real-world scenarios to deepen your understanding.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Week 3 to explore data structures and algorithms in Java.
